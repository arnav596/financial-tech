  <h2>How Inflation Affects Savings</h2>

  <p>
    Inflation refers to the continuous increase in the prices of goods and services over time.
    As inflation rises, the purchasing power of money decreases. This means that the same amount
    of money buys fewer goods and services in the future than it does today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inflation directly impacts personal savings. If your savings grow at a rate lower than
    inflation, you are effectively losing money in real terms. Many people believe saving
    money in a bank account is enough, but inflation silently reduces the value of those savings.
  </p>

  <h3>Real-Life Example</h3>
  <p>
    Suppose you saved ₹1,00,000 in a bank FD earning 5% annually. If inflation is 7%,
    your money is actually losing value even though the balance increases on paper.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over long periods, inflation can significantly erode savings meant for retirement,
    education, or emergencies. That is why understanding inflation is essential for
    long-term financial planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    To protect savings from inflation, individuals should consider inflation-beating
    options such as long-term mutual funds, diversified investments, and disciplined
    strategies like SIPs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inflation is unavoidable, but its impact can be managed with proper financial education
    and informed decision-making.

  <h2>Financial Literacy</h2>

  <p>
    Financial literacy is the ability to understand and manage personal finances effectively.
    It includes knowledge about income, expenses, saving, investing, loans, inflation,
    and financial planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    A financially literate person can make informed decisions that improve long-term
    financial security and reduce stress related to money.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Financial Literacy Matters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps manage income wisely</li>
    <li>Prevents unnecessary debt</li>
    <li>Encourages saving and investing</li>
    <li>Improves long-term financial stability</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real-Life Example</h3>
  <p>
    Two people earn the same salary. One tracks expenses and invests regularly.
    The other spends without planning. After 10 years, their financial positions
    are completely different — knowledge makes the difference.
  </p>

  <p>
    Financial literacy is not about becoming rich quickly. It is about building
    discipline, awareness, and control over money.

  <h2>SIP vs Fixed Deposit (FD)</h2>

  <p>
    SIP and FD are two popular financial tools used by Indian households.
    Both serve different purposes and suit different risk profiles.
  </p>

  <h3>What is SIP?</h3>
  <p>
    A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) allows you to invest a fixed amount regularly
    into mutual funds, benefiting from compounding and rupee cost averaging.
  </p>

  <h3>What is FD?</h3>
  <p>
    A Fixed Deposit offers guaranteed returns with low risk but usually lower
    growth compared to market-linked options.
  </p>

  <h3>Real-Life Comparison</h3>
  <p>
    A 20-year SIP investment may outperform inflation significantly,
    while an FD may struggle to maintain purchasing power.
  </p>

  <p>
    SIP is suitable for long-term goals, while FD works well for short-term safety needs.

  <h2>Money Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

  <p>

  <ul>
    <li>Not budgeting</li>
    <li>Ignoring savings</li>
    <li>Overusing credit cards</li>
    <li>Not planning for retirement</li>
    <li>Following tips blindly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Knowledge About Share Market</h2>

  <p>
    The share market allows individuals to participate in the growth of companies.
    Investors buy shares and benefit through price appreciation and dividends.
  </p>

  <h3>Why People Invest</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Wealth creation</li>
    <li>Inflation protection</li>
    <li>Long-term financial goals</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real-Life Example</h3>
  <p>
    Long-term investors in strong companies often benefit from compounding and growth.

  <h2>How SIP Helps Achieve Dreams</h2>

  <p>
    SIPs help individuals convert life goals into achievable financial plans.
    Whether it is education, retirement, or buying a home, SIPs provide discipline.
  </p>

  <h3>Why SIP Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Power of compounding</li>
    <li>Rupee cost averaging</li>
    <li>Regular investing habit</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real-Life Example</h3>
  <p>
    A small monthly SIP started early can grow into a large corpus over time.
