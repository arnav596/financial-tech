<h2>What Is Trading?</h2>
<p>
Trading refers to the buying and selling of financial instruments such as stocks,
commodities, currencies, or derivatives within a short time period to take advantage
of price movements.
</p>

<p>
Unlike long-term investing, where the goal is wealth creation over many years,
trading focuses on short-term opportunities. Traders aim to buy at a lower price
and sell at a higher price (or vice versa) within minutes, hours, or days.
</p>

<p>
Trading requires market knowledge, discipline, emotional control, and risk management.
Without these skills, trading can lead to significant financial losses.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>How Trading Works</h2>
<p>
Trading is done through a stock market exchange using a trading account and broker.
Prices of financial instruments move based on demand, supply, company performance,
economic data, global events, and market sentiment.
</p>

<p>
Traders use tools such as charts, indicators, and market analysis to make decisions.
However, market movements are uncertain, and losses are common even for experienced traders.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Types of Trading</h2>

<h3>1. Intraday Trading</h3>
<p>
Intraday trading involves buying and selling stocks within the same trading day.
All positions are closed before the market closes.
This type of trading is highly risky and requires constant monitoring.
</p>

<h3>2. Swing Trading</h3>
<p>
Swing trading involves holding positions for a few days or weeks.
It is slightly less risky than intraday trading but still requires technical analysis.
</p>

<h3>3. Positional Trading</h3>
<p>
Positional trading involves holding stocks for weeks or months.
It is closer to investing but still involves market timing.
</p>

<h3>4. Options and Futures Trading</h3>
<p>
Derivatives trading (options and futures) is extremely complex and risky.
Most retail traders lose money in this segment.
It is NOT recommended for beginners.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Risks Involved in Trading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>High market volatility</li>
  <li>Emotional decision-making</li>
  <li>Possibility of rapid losses</li>
  <li>Over-trading and excessive brokerage</li>
  <li>Leverage risk in derivatives</li>
</ul>

<p>
Trading losses can happen quickly, and recovering from them requires discipline and patience.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why Trading Is Not Safe for Beginners</h2>
<p>
Beginners often enter trading with unrealistic expectations.
Lack of knowledge, emotional reactions, and absence of a proper strategy
are the main reasons beginners lose money.
</p>

<p>
Without experience, beginners may panic during losses or become overconfident during profits,
leading to poor decisions.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Which Type of Trading Should a Beginner Choose?</h2>
<p>
Ideally, beginners should avoid active trading altogether.
If someone still wishes to trade, they should:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with paper trading (no real money)</li>
  <li>Avoid derivatives completely</li>
  <li>Trade with very small capital</li>
  <li>Focus on learning rather than earning</li>
</ul>

<p>
For most beginners, <a href="investing.html">long-term investing</a> is safer and more suitable.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why Most People Lose Money in Options and Futures</h2>
<p>
Options and futures involve leverage, which magnifies both profits and losses.
Small price movements can result in large losses.
</p>

<p>
Lack of understanding, time decay in options, and emotional pressure
cause most retail traders to lose money consistently.
</p>

<h2>Real-Life Example</h2>
<p>
Rahul, a young professional, started options trading after watching online videos.
Within three months, he lost a large portion of his savings due to lack of experience
and emotional decisions.
</p>

<p>
After the loss, Rahul focused on learning about long-term investing and risk management.
This example highlights why trading without proper knowledge can be dangerous.
