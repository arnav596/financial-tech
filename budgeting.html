  <h2>What is Budgeting?</h2>
  <p>
    Budgeting is the process of planning how you will spend and save your money each month. It helps you track income, control expenses, and ensure that you do not spend more than you earn. A budget gives your money a purpose and helps you achieve both short-term and long-term financial goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you are a student, salaried employee, freelancer, or business owner, budgeting is the foundation of good financial health. Without a budget, it becomes easy to overspend, rely on credit cards, and struggle with savings.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Budgeting is Important</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps you control unnecessary spending</li>
    <li>Ensures regular savings every month</li>
    <li>Reduces financial stress and anxiety</li>
    <li>Helps you prepare for emergencies</li>
    <li>Supports long-term goals like buying a house or retirement</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    People often believe budgeting is restrictive, but in reality, it gives you freedom. When you know exactly where your money goes, you can spend confidently without guilt.

  <h2>Popular Budgeting Methods</h2>
  <h3>1. 50/30/20 Rule</h3>
  <p>
    Allocate 50% of income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. This is ideal for beginners.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Zero-Based Budget</h3>
  <p>
    Every rupee is assigned a job so that income minus expenses equals zero. This method gives maximum control.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Envelope System</h3>
  <p>
    Cash is divided into envelopes for different categories like food, rent, and entertainment. Once an envelope is empty, spending stops.
