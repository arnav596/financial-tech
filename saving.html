    <h2>What Is Saving?</h2>
    <p>
        Saving means setting aside a portion of your income for future use instead of spending it immediately.
        It helps you handle emergencies, achieve short-term goals, and build long-term financial stability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you are a student, salaried employee, or self-employed, saving money is a basic financial habit
        that reduces stress and increases financial confidence.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why Saving Money Is Important</h2>
    <p>
        Many people face financial difficulties not because they earn too little, but because they save too little.
        Saving protects you from unexpected expenses such as medical emergencies, job loss, or urgent repairs.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Creates an emergency fund</li>
        <li>Reduces dependency on loans and credit cards</li>
        <li>Helps achieve goals like travel, education, or buying a home</li>
        <li>Improves mental peace and financial confidence</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-Life Example: How Saving Changed Financial Stability</h2>
    <p>
        Anjali, a 28-year-old working professional, earned ₹35,000 per month but struggled financially.
        She spent most of her income and had no savings for emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        After learning basic saving techniques, she started saving ₹5,000 every month in a recurring deposit
        and built an emergency fund within one year.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a medical emergency occurred, she did not need a loan. This simple habit improved her financial
        security and reduced stress.
